  <p>i wanted a place where i could just throw in my paycheck and it tells me how much to put where for savings and bidgeting purposes, sooo.</p>
  <p>here it is</p>
  <p>for right now i'm just going to my plan as the defaoult, but i'll probably have a non-hard coded thing so if the savings percentage need to be adjusted it can be. because ya know, flexibility and usability is pretty fun :)</p>

  <div class="slidecontainer">
    <p>how much was your paycheck?</p>
    <p id="payDisplay"> 100
    <input type="range" min="1" max="2500" value="100" class="slider" id="payRange">
  </div>

</body>
