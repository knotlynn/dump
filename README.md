# dump
where i dump random programs that i do in my free time

there's literally nothing of any importance here, but the repository gives me much serotonin. There's a few programs of me actually trying to re-teach myself actual programming
concepts, but also really stupid ones that exist for no reason and fulfill no real purpose

## web pages stored in this repository:
* [Banana Mushiness Scale](https://knotlynn.github.io/dump/html/banana/index.html)
  - gives the user a sassy remark based on how mushy the user says the banana is on a scale of 1 - 10
  - currently incomplete, but still pretty fun :)
  - thanks [brandon](https://github.com/Brandon-The-Developer) for helping with this one! 
* [Password Protected](https://knotlynn.github.io/dump/html/passwordProtection/index.html)
  - i'm trying to learn password protection in HTML
  - it's not working yet
