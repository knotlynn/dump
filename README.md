# dump
where i dump random programs that i do in my free time

there's literally nothing of any importance here, but the repository gives me much joy. There's a few programs of me actually trying to re-teach myself actual programming
concepts, but also really stupid ones that exist for no reason and fulfill no real purpose

## web pages stored in this repository:
