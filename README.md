# dump
where i dump random programs that i do in my free time

there's litterally nothing of any importance here, but the repository gives me much serotonin. There's a few programs of me actually trying to re-teach myself actual programming 
concpets, but also really stupid ones that exist for no reason and fulfill no real purpose

## web pages stored in this repository:
* [Banana Mushines Scale](https://knotlynn.github.io/dump/html/banana/index.html)
  - gives the user a sassy remark based on how mushy the user says the banana is based on a scale of 1 - 10
  - currently incomplete, but still pretty fun :)
* nothing else so far
